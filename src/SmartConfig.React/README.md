This is a [React](https://react.dev) project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Open [https://localhost:5175](https://localhost:5175) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the application by modifying `src/App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Key Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.
- `npm run dev-cert`: Generates a self-signed certificate for local HTTPS development.
